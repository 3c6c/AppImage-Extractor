change it to your desired location.

# How to run
it is highly recommended to use full path of the file instead of just giving filename to the script. 
The script expects an argument to be passed which is file path, example usage:
```bash
chmod +x appimage-extractor
appimage-extractor /path_to_file/filename
```
